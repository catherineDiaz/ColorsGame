# Homework 6

## What I Planned On

- Complete 3D representation of WaterColor
- Enable user to travel back home from WaterColor
- Change character to not be the current guy



## What I Accomplished
- Completed 2nd Universe (WaterColor) . This universe is a maze that has powers hidden in it that turn some of the walls in the maze transparent to make it easier to complete
- Completed 3D represenation of WaterColor Universe
- User can travel back from WaterColor by finding the token at the end of the maze
- Did not change the character because I am still searching for a good 3D model of a new character
- I did completely redo the look of the game, something happened with the original files and I had to rebuild the game
