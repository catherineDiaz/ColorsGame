# Homework 3

## What I Planned On
- The character class will be finished
- The character will be able to move around and collect stuff if it runs into something
- There will also be a very rough representation of the homeland that the character will walk on and explore



## What I Accomplished
- The character (now named Player) class is finished.  There is also a generic Singleton object that was created.  The Player object inherits the Singleton object, making the player a Singleton
- The player can move around using the arrow keys, for now the player is a just a person representation but that will be changed later
- The player is able to collected a power and use it
- The rough representation of the homeland is completed
- 1/3 of the powers is functional, the power where the player can transform into a ball and roll around
- I created a UI object to handle all UI elements of the game, it currently can support the UI that comes up when the player collects a power.  For example if a player runs into a collectable object, a UI appears asking the player if they want to use the power now or would like to use it later.
- I created a CameraFollow object as well so that the camera is always on the character while it is moving



## What I Plan to Accomplish for Next Time
- Rough 3D representation of the 1st universe
- Universe class completed
- 1st universe (Paint) completed
